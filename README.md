# C-project
This project was a university assignment written in C++ 2017.

It takes in any number of files, and sorts the lines in them, using a choice of five different data structures.
List - A custom written linked list.
Tree - A custom written binary tree.
Stdlist - A C++ list.
Set - a C++ set.
Vector - a C++ vector.

The program's primary purpose was to test the speed of the datastructures, but it also outputs all the input files combined into one sorted file.
